This code was developed for analysis of the RESONEUT detector array at FSU.

Some Methods and functions have been adapted from the methods used in our SpecTcl analysis program developed by Ingo Wiedenhoever,Patrick Peplowski, Alex Rojas, Jessica Baker, and myself.  SpecTcl was developed by Ron Fox at NSCL.

Daniel Santiago provided help with understanding ROOT functionality as well as providing examples of his scripts which I have integrated into my classes.  (primarily in the detector classes and ChannelMap)

The RNUnpack2Root included here unpacks from the new RING_MASTER (NSCL) method of data buffering wheras the evt2root, used by Daniel, uses the older 'Fixed Buffer' method.  This older method was (and is still being used) for experiments with ANASEN.  As of 5/15 only ResoNeut has been upgraded to the newer firmware. 

Setups i've tested these modules on:
on my laptop:i686 linux mint 14 
compiles with gcc v4.7.2
root 5.34/patch 03

on fabulous:i386 linux Red-Hat
compiles with gcc v4.1.2
root 5.34/patch 04



INSTALLING:
****************************************
After cloning from the repo,
add 2 directories to resoneut_analysis_hc/
mkdir bin
mkdir lib

typing 'make' while in resoneut_analysis_hc/include  will install RN_BatchMode to the bin/ folder and the shared library to the lib/ folder

typing 'make' while in resoneut_analysis_hc/. will look inside resoneut_analysis_hc/include as well as the subdirectories in resoneut_analysis_hc/plugins and make everything.  the method i'm using is not ideal for big projects but just to get started this was the solution.

be sure to add /path/to/this/folder/lib to your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and next
Load->("libRNeut.so") into your root session to run interactively.

I recommend adding it to your rootlogon.C so you don't have to repeat this process repeatedly.

for a quick use of the Unpacker
execute ~/path_to_resoneut_analysis_hc/bin/RNBatchMode <data dir> <output.root file>

ie) /path_to/RNBatchMode /data/LSU/ run2008.root
    2008 (to unpack from run 2008)
    0 (to finish entering run numbers)

Known Issues:
****************************************************
If when installing you get the error "RNRootDict already exists" you must do "Make newdict" to delete those files.  It shouldn't be like this its just how I have the dependencies written in the Makefile and I have not changed them yet.  You can also just do Make clean and start from scratch.

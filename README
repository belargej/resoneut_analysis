This code was developed for analysis of the RESONEUT detector array at FSU.

Some Methods and functions have been adapted from the methods used in our SpecTcl analysis program developed by Ingo Wiedenhoever,Patrick Peplowski, Alex Rojas, Jessica Baker, and myself.  SpecTcl was developed by Ron Fox at NSCL.

Daniel Santiago provided help with understanding ROOT functionality as well as providing examples of his scripts which I have integrated into my classes.  (primarily in the detector classes and ChannelMap)

The RN_EventProcessor unpacks from the new RING_MASTER (NSCL) format of data buffers.

Setups i've tested these modules on:
on my laptop:i686 linux mint 14 
compiles with gcc v4.7.2
root 5.34/patch 03

on fabulous:i386 linux Red-Hat
compiles with gcc v4.1.2
root 5.34/patch 04


INSTALLING:
****************************************
After cloning from the repo,
add 2 directories to resoneut_analysis_hc/
mkdir bin
mkdir lib

typing 'make' while in resoneut_analysis_hc/include  will install RN_BatchMode to the bin/ folder and the shared library to the lib/ folder

typing 'make' while in resoneut_analysis_hc/. will look inside resoneut_analysis_hc/include as well as the subdirectories in resoneut_analysis_hc/plugins and make everything.  the method i'm using is not ideal for big projects but just to get started this was the solution.

be sure to add /path/to/this/folder/lib to your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and next
Load->("libRNCore.so") into your root session to run interactively.

I recommend adding it to your rootlogon.C so you don't have to repeat this process repeatedly.

for a quick use of the Unpacker
execute ~/path_to_resoneut_analysis_hc/bin/RNBatchMode <data dir> <output.root file>

ie) /path_to/RNBatchMode /data/LSU/ run2008.root
    2008 (to unpack from run 2008)
    0 (to finish entering run numbers)

Known Issues:
****************************************************
Some versions of ROOT have the header files in the include directory: 
${ROOTSYS}/include
and some have it in an extra subdirectory:
${ROOTSYS}/include/root 
I've added both paths to the Makefiles, but if you get an error related to this and you are certain that your ${ROOTSYS} path is properly configured then the problem is likely related to this path difference.

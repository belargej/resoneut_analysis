Shared libraries which contain the RN_Analysis code are stored here.  In order to add these libraries to an active root session you must do(e.g):

gSystem->Load("/Path/to/this/folder/libRNCore.so");

or you can add this directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH env and then do

gSystem->Load("libRNCore.so");

in an active root session.

If you source RNSetup.sh (where RNSetup.sh is in the bin folder) it will set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to this RN_Analysis code directory.
